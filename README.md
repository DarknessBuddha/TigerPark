# TigerPark
CUHackit Project

TigerPark is a parking lot web application that helps users find good parking on Clemson's campus. It integrates reservation time slots to reserve a parking spot in one of the 15 parking lots. An interactive map displays the lots and some general information. You can login to an existing account and use the Find a Spot feature to reserve a time slot.
